When work with UI on the Web. MVC doesn't fit well. because
for the View (a combination of CSS, HTML and Javascript).
and Model (a combination of embedded HTML input or pure JSON object) can be complicated.

The one thing that seems to be consistent is the Controller. 
However a good controller is hard because: 
1. State maintaince.
2. Code between application logic and conditional execution of the View.

Consider the scenario (2).
